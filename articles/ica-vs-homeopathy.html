    <h1>ICA and Homeopathy: A Comparative View on Root Healing</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Indian Classical Acupuncture (ICA) and Homeopathy may appear very different on the surface 
      – one uses touch or fine needles, the other uses highly diluted remedies – but both share a 
      deep commitment to <strong>root healing</strong>, focusing on the whole person rather than just symptoms.
    </p>

    <h2>Similarities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole-Person Healing:</strong> Both see illness as an imbalance in body, mind, and spirit.</li>
      <li><strong>Root Cause Focus:</strong> They aim to correct the origin of disease, not just its outer signs.</li>
      <li><strong>Individualization:</strong> No two people with the same disease are treated alike; the inner state guides treatment.</li>
      <li><strong>Subtle Energy:</strong> Both recognize that health depends on invisible forces – vital energy in ICA, vital force in Homeopathy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Differences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Method:</strong> ICA uses single-point needling or touch guided by pulse and elemental balance; 
          Homeopathy prescribes remedies made from natural substances.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> ICA relies on <em>pulse reading</em>, body observation, and five-element theory; 
          Homeopathy relies on a detailed case history of mind and emotions.</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate vs Gradual:</strong> ICA can sometimes bring instant energetic shifts; 
          Homeopathy often works gently and gradually over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Philosophical Roots</h2>
    <p>
      ICA grows from ancient Indian elemental theory, linking the body to Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Wood.  
      Homeopathy was founded in Europe by Dr. Hahnemann, who saw disease as a disturbance of the “vital force.”  
      Despite their different origins, both value <strong>harmony and inner balance</strong> above symptom suppression.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      ICA and Homeopathy are not rivals but companions. Each offers unique tools for root healing, 
      and both remind us that true cure comes from restoring balance in the whole person – body, mind, and spirit.
